# Starter Module

The main point of this repo is for use with BVA's CLI, but the CLI isn't required and this can be used without it.

_You should replace everything in this file with the documentation for your module_

This comes with Webpack preconfigured in case you're creating a module that needs to run on non-slate projects. Just make sure your entrypoint code is written in /src/index.js then run `yarn build` to get a /dist folder with your code.
